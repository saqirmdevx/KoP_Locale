# How to add translation?

Consider following example:
default_spell.ts

```ts
/** Bunninja */
case SpellList.BUNNINJA_AUTOATTACK:
   return {
      en: `Bunninja slashes with his carrot and deals  ${getDamage(BunninjaAbilityData.AUTOATTACK_DAMAGE_MOD * damage)} damage.`,
      ru: `Банниндзя взмахивает своей морковью, нанося ${getDamage(BunninjaAbilityData.AUTOATTACK_DAMAGE_MOD * damage)} физического урона.`,
   }
```

You are looking only at the returning part, all datas inside ${ .. } are constants (values taken from a game engine)
If you wanna add new language you will do this (consider SK lang)

Example:

```ts
/** Bunninja */
case SpellList.BUNNINJA_AUTOATTACK:
   return {
      en: `Bunninja slashes with his carrot and deals  ${getDamage(BunninjaAbilityData.AUTOATTACK_DAMAGE_MOD * damage)} damage.`,
      ru: `Банниндзя взмахивает своей морковью, нанося ${getDamage(BunninjaAbilityData.AUTOATTACK_DAMAGE_MOD * damage)} физического урона.`,
      sk: `Your translated text to your language ${CONSTANT_VALUE}`,
   }
```
